# NlbPipeline

## Why?

This project was done as a prototype from a hackathon for a real-time job/notification pipeline for employees in [a bank (NLB)](http://www.nlb.mk).

## Usage

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
